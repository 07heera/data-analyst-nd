This repository contains files used for [uDacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) which I briefly worked on in April, June and July 2016. 

The courses are excellent, featuring high quality lectures and interactive exercises with answers for every 5-10 minutes of lecture material. They can be accessed for free (as of 25 June 2016) via the links below or via _'Nanodegree Program Syllabus' -> Supporting Courses_ on [the Data Analyst Nanodegree page](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). They may be challenging for students with no programming experience.

__Note-taking__:

I started taking notes while studying [2. Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170), where I took notes in the form of Anki flashcards. With [3. Intro to Data Wrangling with MongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032), I shifted to using iPython Notebooks (with the mind to add a layer of Anki flashcards on top later) so I could examine code and have a flow of the lesson I could revisit.
